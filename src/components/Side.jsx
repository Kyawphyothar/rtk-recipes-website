          A side dish, sometimes referred to as a side order, side item, or
          simply a side, is a food item that accompanies the entr√©e or main
          course at a meal. Side dishes such as salad, potatoes and bread are
          commonly used with main courses throughout many countries of the
          western world. New side orders introduced within the past
          decade[citation needed], such as rice and couscous, have grown to be
          quite popular throughout Europe, especially at formal occasions (with
          couscous appearing more commonly at dinner parties with Middle Eastern
          dishes).
