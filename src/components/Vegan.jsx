          Veganism is both the practice of abstaining from the use of animal
          products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that
          rejects the commodity status of animals.[b] A follower of either the
          diet or the philosophy is known as a vegan (pronounced /'vi:gan/
          VEE-g…ôn). Distinctions are sometimes made between several categories
          of veganism. Dietary vegans (or strict vegetarians) refrain from
          consuming animal products, not only meat but also eggs, dairy products
          and other animal-derived substances.[c] The term ethical vegan is
          often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the
          philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of
          animals for any purpose.[d] Another term is environmental veganism,
          which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that
          the harvesting or industrial farming of animals is environmentally
          damaging and unsustainable.
